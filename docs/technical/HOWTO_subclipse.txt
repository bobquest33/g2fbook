How to branch with Subclipse
Nice advice on the subclipse-users mailing list by Mark Phippard

Do Team -> Update on your project so that your entire working copy is updated to a single, known revision.
Do Team -> Create Branch/Tag and create a branch directly in the repository using that known revision.
Do Team -> Switch to swap your working copy to the branch. Since it was already based on that revision, this will be quick and simple.
Do Team -> Commit to commit your changes to the branch.
Do Team -> Switch to swap back to trunk.
