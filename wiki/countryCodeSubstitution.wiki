#summary About possible problems outside Germany.

Currently, the transformation does some substitution to the country code in all phone numbers.<br>
If the number on gmail starts with +49, this code will be substituted by 0. Eg. +491234567 will become 01234567.<br>
This is ok as long as you are in Germany, but you will experience problems if not.

<br><br><br>

To get it sorted out, you will currently have to edit the file googleContacts-2-fritzPhoneBook.xml.<br>
This is the code responsible for the substitution:

{{{
79    <!-- format number -->
80    <xsl:variable name="number">
81      <xsl:choose>
82        <!-- domestic -->
83        <xsl:when test="contains(.,'+49')">
84          <!-- +49 / 0 replace -->
85          <xsl:variable name="tmpnumber"><xsl:value-of select="concat('0',substring-after(.,'+49'))"/></xsl:variable>
86          <!-- only numbers may stay -->
87          <xsl:value-of select="translate($tmpnumber,translate($tmpnumber,'1234567890',''),'')"/>
88        </xsl:when>
89        <!-- foreign -->
90        <xsl:otherwise>
91          <!-- only number and + may stay -->
92          <xsl:value-of select="translate(.,translate(.,'1234567890+',''),'')"/>
93        </xsl:otherwise>
94      </xsl:choose>
95    </xsl:variable>
}}}
^Line numbers apply to r12 of the file^

In line 83 and line 85, you can edit the country code that will be removed (+49)<br>
In line 85 you can edit the number that will replace the country code (0)<br>

If you don't want any substitution that code,
you can simply remove<br>
lines 81 - 90 and 93 - 94
